1, 2 = Install and setup MQTT broker
3 = Add User and Pass to HomeAssistant for FreeDS MQTT login
4 = Create New Automation with Time Pattern Trigger and Publish Solar and Grid values to FreeDS 
5, 6 = Add at least 4 MQTT Publish Actions and modify the Entity Names in the Payload_Template line + convert the values if needed
7 = Access and config FreeDS from a web browser > Select ICC Solar (MQTT)
8 = MQTT Settings > Add HomeAssistant Static IP Address + User + Pass
9 = Temperature Sensor Settings (3x DS18B20)
10 = Relays Settings > Edit Connected load with your Boiler Power
11 = Optional External FAN for Mosfet Heatsink on Relay4 output (connect the FAN to an external transistor to turn ON/OFF)
12 = Console > PID tuning command, needed when slow response time from inverter/powermeter was set (above 15 seconds => slow down the PID).
13 = Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration > search for FreeDS
14 = FreeDS added successfully
15 = Optional Automation, to Enable/Disable the diverter at a specific time or High Grid Voltage value

PS: Use static IP for FreeDS diverter, HomeAssistant and Inverter/Powermeter
